This study carries a few limitations. First, this study adopted a convenience sampling and therefore the sample cannot generalize to the general population. Second, the sample consists a larger proportion of younger people (<= 24) and older people (55+), with smaller proportions of middle-aged population. Third, the data is a cross-sectional data and therefore no causal relationship can be drawn. Future studies should adopt a longitudinal or experimental approach to examine the factors influencing peopleâ€™s HRQoL. Fourth, it is noteworthy to mention that the norms scores were generated from 2016. The differences between the scores collected in this study and the norms may be due to COVID-19, but there is another possibility that the lower score is due to the continuous effects of the social and political unrest in Hong Kong (). Fifth, we used a single-item question to measure loneliness, which may not be able to capture different dimensions of loneliness, namely social and emotional loneliness. 

The present study implies the importance of paying special attentions to (1) older people; (2) those with lower subjective social status; (3) people with a higher loneliness level. Older people not only experience particular vulnerability in infecting COVID-19; they also need to bear the potential influence of delayed medical consultation and reduced time meeting with immediate and extended families.
